GUI Hangman game for hangman lovers who need to kill some time at work. 

written in Python3, it is a simple code with a log list of words which are picked at Random for every new game. 

If you want to run it in Python3, the only dependency aside from the obvious python3 is tk.

Feel free to Pull, and being new to Python, I appreciate any suggestions or tips. 

Enjoy!
